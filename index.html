        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting places on the way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla,WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        </ol>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
        road today: <blockquote>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get
            you, A glimpsem Of eternity.</blockquote>I definitely won't be Passing
        any cars.

        My fisrt day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Sagwway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>cell phone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camara</li> 
            <li>protein bar</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Just the essentials. As 
        Lao Tzu would have said, <blockquote>A journal of a thousand miles begins
        with one Sagway.</blockquote>
